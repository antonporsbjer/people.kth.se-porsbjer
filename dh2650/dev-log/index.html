                        <h3><b>So many hotfixes</b></h3>
                        <p>
                            The past few days have been a lot of work. In order to make all of the different parts of the game working as
                            intended, sorting out different bugs, and making it come together as a complete experience the way we envisioned 
                            it, a lot of hours had to be put into it. For me and Jenna, having a bit more experience with Unity and building 
                            project in Unity this meant that we had to make lots of small tweaks and changes, updating prefabs, and writing new 
                            code. I even had to push a new build of the game to the website shortly before our demo due to a bug with the collision
                            making it impossible to get past a certain point of the level.
                            <br><br>
                            But we also had a lot of fun during the last crunch
                            time (maybe the most fun we've hade during the entire project), Alex is apparently very good at breaking games and 
                            we all had a big laugh watching him try to break our game and we even found some speed-running strategies.
                            <br></br>
                            Finally I think the final presentation and demo turned out great and I am very proud of what we have accomplished. ðŸŽ‰

                        <p>
                            The game is really starting to come together, but as was mentioned during the the last status update the sliding-puzzles
                            really needed some work since it is one of our core game mechanics. So that is what I have been working on lately, I have
                            with e little help from Jenna been able to get the tileset she created in to the puzzle and having it move correctly within
                            the custom matrix system I built for the sliding-puzzles. I have also setup puzzle-doors throughout the level and the puzzle
                            to make the game a bit more challenging and complex. And I have updated the camera for the puzzle and making it so that the frame around the puzzle
                            is visible when the puzzle camera is active.

                        <p>
                            We decided on having a parallax effect on the background and foreground objects. This meant I had to completely
                            redo the camera system we aready had in place since it was implemented using an orthographic camera, this means
                            that it does not account for the Z-position of objects meaning that all objecs rendered by the camera appears to
                            be at the same distance from the camera. In order to get the parallax effect with objects moving in different speed
                            relative to the camera position we had to change to a perspective camera. This also means that we have to remove
                            the individual room dividers since this won't work with a perspective camera. I also had to learn a bit about the 
                            <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-SpriteRenderer.html">Unity Sprite Render</a> and sorting layers.
                            In order to get the sprites to render correctly you cannot just edit the Z-position of the sprites you also have to
                            tell the rendering pipeline in what order to render the sprites in. I have updated every object in the scene to put
                            them on the correct sprite layer.

                        <h3><b>Background objects and music and more</b></h3>
                        <p>
                            Jenna has created a background and background objects that I have added to the main scene. I also added gems and health hearts Malin made to the scene. 
                            We also decided on background music for the game which I added to the main scene. 
                            <br><br>
                            Jenna and I also tweaked the movement of the character. We updated the movement speed, acceleration and deceleration,
                            and tweaked the jump to make it more accurate. We spent quite some time on this. The character movement used the drag parameter of the rigidbody
                            for both jumping and deceleration. The character was sliding a lot before coming to a stop, which made it hard to control the character, especially
                            on floating platforms. But if we increased the drag it also affected the jump, making her barely jump at all. We wrote our own deceleration in the movement script, 
                            and encountered some amusing bugs along the way before we got it all to work. For example, you could gain a lot speed by quickly running back and forth.

                            I have been busy maintaining different parts of the game. For example, Malin has made a new movement system 
                            for the characters which I have integrated into to our main game scene. I've also added my new camera system to the main scene.
                            <br><br>
                            I have worked on the sliding puzzle, adding triggers for entering and exiting the puzzle.
                            <br><br>
                            Jenna has created a tileset which I have also integrated into the main scene by creating a tile palette in Unity. 
                            I also continuously tweaked Alex's level design to make the proportions and feel better to move through, and updateing
                            the tiles to the new tileset.

                        <p>
                            I made a new camera system inspired by <a href="https://youtu.be/FqBj2IGg6Uw?t=22"'>Celeste's camera system</a>,
                            it is built using an orthographic camera constraint by colliders to make sure that the camera stays within the
                            bounds of each room. I used this YouTube video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaQlRvHgIvE">Celeste's 
                            Camera Follow - Unity Cinemachine Tutorial</a>, as a basis for the camera system and you can see from the image above
                            how all rooms are split up using colliders. I think it turned out pretty good and gives a nice feel to the game.

                        <p>
                            I might have forgotten to post updates on the project and what I have been up to for a while.
                            Recently we have mostly been looking at the business side of the game, how to sell it, 
                            who are our competitors, and more. Other than that I have been experimenting with the level 
                            layout within Unity and trying to figure out if we should go with a tile-based 2D sprite approach
                            or a 2.5D environment. After some testing and consulting with the other group members, we have desided 
                            on going with the 2D sprite-based approach. I have laid out the level based Alex level design 
                            using a free-to-use tilemap and also testing to create a couple of tiles myself to moderate success.<br><br>
                            I have also continued working on the sliding puzzles. The tiles are now movable with the arrow keys, and the 
                            player can zoom out to see the whole puzzle by pressing the M key. I also made the player move with the puzzle
                            rooms when the rooms are moved (before they character would stay at its position and possibly get stuck in a wall
                            or fall down.) I also made some updates to the puzzle camera, and I made the camera go back to the main camera
                            I the player moves away from the puzze.

                            During our first "sprint" i have been working on the sliding-puzzle macanic. It was constructed using a 
                            n by m matrix filled with puzzle-tiles objects. The puzzle-tile class keeps track of the tile position 
                            within the matrix and updates it's position and world position to make it easy to controll the puzzle and 
                            expand/schink it if needed.
